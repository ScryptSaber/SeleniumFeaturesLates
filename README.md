<h3>Chrome Dev tools:</h3>

In the new version of Selenium, they have made some internal changes in the API. Earlier in Selenium 3, the Chrome driver extends directly to the Remote Web Driver class. But now in Selenium 4, Chrome driver class extends to Chromium Driver. Chromium Driver class has some predefined methods to access the dev tool.

Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP) is a set of APIs that allows developers to communicate with Chromium-based browsers, including Google Chrome. CDP was originally developed to power the Developer Tools features within Chrome, but since its introduction its usage has extended to much more than this initial use-case.

Note: Chromium Driver extends the Remote Web driver class.

By using the API, we can perform the following operations:

1-Enable Network Offline<br />
2-Enable Network Online<br />
3-Get Console Logs<br />
4-Load Insure Web Site<br />
5-Capture/Monitor and stub the network requests and responses<br />
6-Block Network requests<br />
